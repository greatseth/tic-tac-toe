# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Development

If you want to mess with the code, there are 
some Ruby gems you'll want to get. Just type 
`bundle install` in the project root directory, 
and the gems will be installed for you.

## Tests

You can run tests using Rake or by loading 
test/SpecRunner.html in your favorite browser.
